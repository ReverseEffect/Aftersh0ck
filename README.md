Aftersh0ck Framework ReadMe
===========================

This framework provides a few useful tools for developers to use, like a new alert view system that just displays information(for simplicity), a delayed timer version of the alert view included, and a simple advertisement system for iOS apps.

Images for the advertisement system are in PNG/JPG/GIF format and have dimensions of 320 x 50 pixels.
Advertisement system needs testing.

You are free to include the framework in your projects as you please as long as the headers contain the copyright information. You are not required to post credits for work. If you do, however, claim my framework, I will cease development.
